description: Use when an agent needs to operate the user's real Chrome session: listing tabs, snapshotting the page into actionable @refs, clicking, filling, typing into rich editors, pressing keys, evaluating JS, capturing screenshots, and reading console/network buffers. All actions go through CDP and run on backgrounded tabs without stealing focus.

# Chrome Relay

Drives the user's real Chrome through a Chrome extension + local native host. Prefer it when logged-in browser state (auth cookies, sessions, installed extensions) matters.

The page can detect the cursor host element, although its shadow tree is closed.

Keep all automation in the background. Target tabs with `--tab` or qualified refs; never activate a tab, raise a window, or use foreground input as a fallback. `--active` and `switch` are rejected. Run tests and benchmarks only in isolated headless Chromium. Recordings sample screenshots and may miss changes between samples.

The user's real mouse never moves. Instead, each click, hover, fill and type draws the **agent cursor** in that tab: an arrow that glides to the target, pulses on click and wiggles while you're between commands. It shows the user what you're doing when they glance at the tab. It does not wait for its animation before acting; page scripts cannot access its isolated API, snapshots omit it, and `screenshot` hides it. `chrome-relay cursor off` turns it off. Older extensions draw no cursor. CLI 0.9.0 rejects readiness navigation, `--snapshot`, settle and new recording starts against them with `unsupported_tool` / `extension_compatibility` before acting. `navigate --wait none` retains legacy acknowledgment behavior; then wait explicitly for the required page state.

## Setup

1. [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-relay/cpdiapbifblhlcpnmlmfpgfjlacebokb)
2. CLI:
   ```sh
   npm install -g chrome-relay@latest
   chrome-relay install
   chrome-relay --version
   chrome-relay doctor
   ```

The new `--snapshot` browsing loop, navigation readiness, background recordings and agent cursor require **CLI/native host 0.9.0 and extension 0.9.0**. Run `chrome-relay --version` and `chrome-relay profile list`; inspect `hostVersion` and `extensionVersion` for every profile you use. `chrome-relay update` updates the CLI/native host; Chrome updates each installed extension separately. Until both sides are 0.9.0, use separate actions, navigate with `--wait none`, and wait for the specific element/text you need before taking a snapshot.

Use the latest CLI. Multi-browser/profile routing and uploads require >= 0.8.0; Dia detection and the agent-friendly profile picker require >= 0.8.1. If the printed version stays below 0.8 after installing, stop and resolve the stale binary on `PATH` before using 0.8 commands:
```sh
chrome-relay --version
which -a chrome-relay        # macOS/Linux; use `where chrome-relay` on Windows
```

If `profile list` is empty but legacy `tabs` works, an old extension has not registered a profile. Update that extension and run `doctor`; an empty registry does not prove that no browser is connected.

At the start of a session, run `chrome-relay profile list`. With one connected instance, normal commands need no profile flag. With several, this tells you exactly which browsers and profiles are reachable before you act.

## The core loop

```sh
chrome-relay tabs                             # find or create a tab
chrome-relay navigate "https://kushalsm.com" --new --snapshot   # open in the background, print its @refs
chrome-relay click @e12 --snapshot            # act on a ref; prints the page after it reacts
chrome-relay fill @e14 "hello"
chrome-relay keys Enter --tab 1234 --snapshot # submit; prints the result page
chrome-relay wait --text "Saved" --tab 1234   # block until a specific condition holds
chrome-relay snapshot --tab 1234 --diff       # print only what changed (~100 tokens)
```

`--snapshot` on `navigate`, `click`, `fill`, `type` and `keys` saves a turn: the action, then an interactive snapshot of the same tab. Input actions first wait for the page to finish reacting (requests done, DOM quiet, at most 2s) or for the navigation they started. `navigate` already returns once the page is usable (`--wait load|commit|none` to change that), and a plain `snapshot` waits for a pending navigation rather than reading a blank tab.

A navigation result with `ready: false` reached its timeout before the page was ready. Do not act on it yet: wait for the URL, element or text you need, then take a fresh snapshot. DOMContentLoaded does not mean every app has finished hydration.

Snapshot output is indented text. Large pages can exceed 100 KB; use a scope, depth cap or a single-value `get` when you need less. Read it directly, no jq needed:

```
- link "Hacker News" [ref=e4]
- textbox "Search" [ref=e41]: current value
- checkbox "Remember me" [checked, ref=e42]
- clickable "Open card" [ref=e88]        # cursor-pointer div the AX tree missed
```

**Refs carry their own tab.** `click @e12` acts on the tab that produced e12, never the active tab. Safe while the user keeps browsing. A contradicting `--tab` errors with `target_conflict`.

**Ref lifetime.** Refs survive same-page DOM churn (cached backendNodeId, healed by role+name re-find when nodes are replaced) but die on real navigation. A dead ref returns `error.code = stale_ref`. Re-run `snapshot`.

**Interception.** Ref clicks hit-test the point first. If an overlay / sticky header / modal owns it, you get `error.code = click_intercepted` naming the interceptor. Dismiss it or scroll, then retry. The click was NOT delivered. `fill`/`type` skip this check (covered inputs are still writable).

## Tool surface

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tabs` | List windows + tabs with their `tabId`s |
| `navigate <url>` | Open in current tab. `--new` opens in a **background** tab. `--active` is rejected. `--tab <id>` retargets an existing tab without selecting it. Returns once the page is usable (DOMContentLoaded) with `ready`, `readyState`, `loadFailed`; `--wait load\|commit\|none` changes that. `--snapshot` also prints the page's refs. |
| `snapshot --tab <id> -i` | Page snapshot with actionable `@refs`: accessibility tree plus cursor-interactive sweep, one ref space, compact text. `-d N` depth cap, `-s <css>` scope to subtree, `-u` include hrefs, `--diff` print only changes since the last snapshot, `--settle` first wait for the page to stop changing, `--json` structured envelope with the refs map. Waits for a pending navigation instead of reading a blank tab (`--no-wait` to skip). |
| `wait <css\|@ref>` / `wait --text` / `--url <glob>` / `--load networkidle` / `--fn <js>` | Block until a condition holds (one per call, default 10s, max 25s). `wait 1500` just sleeps. On timeout the error includes current page state. |
| `get text\|value\|attr\|count\|title\|url <target>` | One value, plain to stdout. No full snapshot. `get text @e12`, `get attr @e7 href`, `get count ".row"`. |
| `batch '[{"name":"chrome_...","args":{...}}, ...]'` | N tool calls in ONE round-trip, sequential, bail-on-error by default. Use wire tool names. |
| `skills get core` | Print this playbook, version-matched to the installed binary. |
| `click <@ref \| selector> --tab <id>` | Trusted hover + press + release at element center (`pointerType: "mouse"`). Refs need no `--tab`. `--snapshot` waits for the page to react, then prints it (also on `fill`, `type`, `keys`). |
| `click --x N --y N --tab <id>` | Coordinate-mode click for canvas/SVG chart internals with no DOM handle. |
| `hover <@ref \| selector \| --x --y>` | Pointer move only. Fires `:hover` styles. |
| `fill <@ref \| selector> <value>` | Atomic value write into `<input>`/`<textarea>`/`<select>`. Bypasses React's value tracker. Refs reach inside shadow DOM (selectors can't). |
| `type <text> [-s <@ref \| selector>]` | CDP `Input.insertText`. Use for contenteditable / Draft.js / Lexical / ProseMirror. **Appends** at caret; clear the input first if it had a value. |
| `keys <chord> --tab <id>` | Single key or chord: `Enter`, `Tab`, `Escape`, `Cmd+K`, `Shift+ArrowDown`. |
| `js <code> --tab <id>` | `Runtime.evaluate` in MAIN world. Use `return` for the value. Top-level `await` works. |
| `screenshot --tab <id> -o <path>` | PNG. `--full` captures beyond viewport. `--max-edge N` resizes. |
| `screencast start --tab <id>` / `screencast stop --tab <id> --out <path>` | Record sampled screenshots in the background, up to 15fps. |
| `network --tab <id>` | HTTP request/response ring buffer, last 200 per tab. `network body <requestId>` fetches a body while Chrome still has it. `network har --with-bodies` exports a HAR with bodies. |
| `console --tab <id>` | `console.log/warn/error` + page exceptions, last 200. |
| `viewport` | Emulate device viewport, DPR, mobile flag, touch, UA. |
| `workspace` / `group` | Manage named windows / tab-groups so multiple agents can drive separate windows. |
| `switch <tabId>` / `close <tabIds...>` | Switch is rejected; use `--tab` to target a tab. Close removes tabs. |
| `cursor [on\|off]` | Show or set the agent cursor (on by default). |
| `self-reload` | Restart the extension's service worker after a rebuild |
| `release-notes --since <ver>` / `update` | Queryable changelog; agent-readable JSON. |
| `call <tool> [json]` | Raw pass-through for any internal tool. |
| `read` / `ax` / `click-ax` | **Deprecated**. Aliases for `snapshot` / `click @ref`. Will be removed; don't use in new work. |

## Picking the right text tool

| Target element | Tool |
|---|---|
| `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>` (including React-controlled, shadow DOM) | `fill @ref` |
| `[contenteditable]`, `role="textbox"`, Draft.js / Lexical / ProseMirror, X compose, LinkedIn DM, new Reddit composer | `type` |
| Submit, navigate menus, modifier shortcuts | `keys` |
| Combobox / autocomplete option selection | `type` into filter, then `keys ArrowDown`, then `keys Enter` ([why](references/patterns.md)) |
| Framework-internal pokes, scraping, custom widgets | `js` |

## Many browsers & profiles (CLI >= 0.8)

The primary supported targets are Google Chrome (including multiple Chrome profiles), Dia, and Brave. One CLI reaches every connected instance where the extension is installed; each Chrome profile is a separate addressable instance.

The installer also knows native-host manifest paths for Chrome Canary, Chromium, Edge, Vivaldi, Arc, and Opera. Treat those as compatibility targets unless the current task has verified them; do not claim that manifest detection alone proves full browser support.

Install the extension once in every browser/profile you want reachable, then run `chrome-relay install` once so every detected browser can spawn its own host.

```sh
chrome-relay profile list             # who's connected: label, browser, id prefix
chrome-relay profile label work       # one connected: label it directly
chrome-relay --profile 3f2a profile label personal  # several: first pick by id prefix
chrome-relay --profile work tabs      # scope any command (global or per-command flag)
chrome-relay click @3f2a:e12          # snapshot refs are profile-qualified and route by THEMSELVES
```

One instance connected: no flags, everything routes implicitly. Several: unscoped commands fail `profile_ambiguous`. Treat the error as a picker: choose one of its exact `--profile <label|idprefix>` entries and rerun the command. It never guesses. Refs carry their profile the way they carry their tab, so after one `snapshot` you rarely need the flag again. Free a stale label with `chrome-relay profile unlabel <name>`.

## Uploads (CLI >= 0.8)

Three strategies, no auto-fallback — the failure names the strategy, pick the next:

```sh
chrome-relay upload set --selector 'input[type=file]' --tab 123 ./cv.pdf   # direct; works on HIDDEN inputs
chrome-relay upload choose --click-ref @e4 ./cv.pdf   # trigger opens the OS picker: intercepted, NO dialog appears
chrome-relay upload drop --selector '.dropzone' ./avatar.png
```

Files are paths — Chrome reads them itself, no size caps. `not_a_file_input` → use choose. `no_file_chooser` → wrong trigger, or it's a drop zone. `file_access_denied` → chrome://extensions → Chrome Relay → "Allow access to file URLs". set/choose return what the input ACTUALLY holds after the call.

## Element addressing: the fallback ladder

1. **`@ref` from `snapshot -i`**: default. Covers buttons/links/inputs, named content, cursor-pointer div-soup (the sweep), and shadow DOM.
2. **CSS selector**: when you know the selector statically and don't need a snapshot.
3. **`js` probe, then coordinate click**: canvas internals and SVG chart segments (anonymous `<path>` elements have no DOM handle anywhere):
   ```sh
   chrome-relay js --tab 1234 "const r = document.querySelector('svg path').getBoundingClientRect(); return {x: r.x + r.width/2, y: r.y + r.height/2}"
   chrome-relay click --tab 1234 --x 312 --y 218
   ```

## Fewer turns

Every command is a turn, and turns cost far more than the browser does. Fold the look into the action:

```sh
chrome-relay click @e12 --snapshot              # act + see the result in one turn
```

When you need one specific outcome, wait for it, then read only what changed:

```sh
chrome-relay click @e12
chrome-relay wait --text "Saved" --tab 1234     # or wait <selector> / --url
chrome-relay snapshot --tab 1234 --diff         # only the changes, refs included
```

With a successful readiness result, `navigate` has already waited for its selected document event. Check `ready` before acting. A `load` wait can be held by images or other resources; wait for the element or text you need instead.

## Top gotchas

0. **`snapshot -i` is for ACTING, not fact extraction.** It prints ref-bearing elements only. Non-interactive values (dashboard metrics, paragraph text, chart labels) drop out. Measured live: a Cloudflare Pages metrics page lost all its numbers under `-i`. To READ facts, use full `snapshot`, `get text <target>`, or a `js` projection.
1. **`type` appends.** It inserts at the caret. If the input had a value (autosaved draft, default text), clear it first via `js` or `keys` (Cmd+A then Backspace).
2. **Refs die on navigation.** `stale_ref` means the page changed under you; re-snapshot. Don't retry the same ref.
3. **Coords go stale fast.** Read `getBoundingClientRect`, scroll/reflow, then click, and you hit the wrong element. For autocomplete popups especially, use keyboard nav, not coord clicks.
4. **Click "succeeded" but nothing happened.** First diagnostic: `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)`. If it returns a wrapper or form background, your coords are wrong. If it returns the right element but state didn't change, you're likely on chrome-relay <0.5.20. Upgrade.

## Operational guidance

- **Don't give up early.** A failing click is information, not a stop signal. Attach a document-level listener with `capture:true` and watch what fires:
  ```sh
  chrome-relay js --tab 1234 "
    ['pointerdown','mousedown','click'].forEach(t =>
      document.addEventListener(t, e => console.log(t, e.target.tagName, e.target.className), {capture:true})
    );
    return 'listening'
  "
  # do the action, then:
  chrome-relay console --tab 1234
  ```
- **Don't echo secrets.** When extracting tokens / API keys via `js`, write the result directly to a file. Never `echo $TOKEN` or interpolate into shell strings. It ends up in scrollback, logs, and tool transcripts.
- **Redact `network` output.** Request/response headers carry cookies, auth/CSRF tokens, account and project IDs. Never paste raw `chrome-relay network` output into chat, docs, issues, or commits. Filter to the fields you need (url, status, timings) or redact headers first.
- **Capture before irreversible actions** (form submit, send message, account change). Save the screenshot path.

## Guardrails

- Errors are structured: branch on `relayError.code` (`stale_ref`, `click_intercepted`, `element_not_found`, `target_conflict`, `profile_ambiguous`, `timeout`), not on message text.
- If a flag is unclear, `chrome-relay <command> --help` is authoritative. These docs lag.
